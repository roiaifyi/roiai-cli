# Dependency Usage Analysis for roiai-cli

## Regular Dependencies Analysis:

### USED Dependencies:
1. @prisma/client - ✓ Used throughout for database operations
2. axios - ✓ Used in api/typed-client.ts for HTTP requests
3. chalk - ✓ Used for terminal color formatting in multiple files
4. cli-table3 - ✓ Used for displaying tables in terminal output
5. commander - ✓ Used for CLI command parsing
6. config - ✓ Used for configuration management
7. ora - ✓ Used for spinner/loading indicators
8. prompts - ✓ Used for interactive CLI prompts
9. uuid - ✓ Used for generating unique identifiers

### Special Case:
- prisma - ✓ Used as CLI tool in npm scripts (prisma:generate, prisma:migrate, prisma:studio)
  This is the Prisma CLI needed for database migrations and schema management

## DevDependencies Analysis:

### UNUSED DevDependencies:
- express - ❌ Not used anywhere in the codebase (checked src/, tests/, scripts/)
  This is odd for a CLI tool and should be removed

### USED DevDependencies:
- @types/uuid - ✓ TypeScript types for uuid package
- @types/prompts - ✓ TypeScript types for prompts package  
- @types/config - ✓ TypeScript types for config package

## Recommendations:
1. Remove `express` from devDependencies as it's not used anywhere
2. All other dependencies are actively used and necessary
