[2025-06-16] BigInt Migration for Message-Related Fields

## Decision Rationale
The user requested changing message-related fields to bigger data types (BigInt) for future-proofing. This is a wise decision as message counts and token usage can grow very large over time.

## Changes Made

### Schema Updates (prisma/schema.prisma)
1. Changed from Int to BigInt for:
   - All `totalMessages` fields across User, Machine, Project, Session models
   - All token-related fields: `totalInputTokens`, `totalOutputTokens`, `totalCacheCreationTokens`, `totalCacheReadTokens`
   - Message model token fields: `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cacheCreationTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`
   - FileStatus fields: `fileSize`, `lastProcessedLine`
   - SyncStatus.id field

2. Kept as Int (per user's clarification):
   - `totalProjects` fields
   - `totalSessions` fields

### Code Updates
1. Fixed aggregation.service.ts:
   - Updated reduce accumulators to use BigInt literals (0n) for proper arithmetic
   - BigInt values are automatically handled by Prisma

2. Fixed incremental-aggregation.service.ts:
   - Updated comparison to handle mixed BigInt and number types
   - totalMessages uses 0n, while totalSessions/totalProjects use 0

3. Fixed all tests to expect BigInt values:
   - Used toBe(0n) instead of toBe(0) for BigInt fields
   - Used BigInt() constructor to convert test data
   - Handled BigInt to number conversions in aggregation tests

## Implementation Process
1. Updated schema file with BigInt types
2. Removed old database and migrations
3. Created fresh migration with new schema
4. Regenerated Prisma client
5. Fixed TypeScript compilation errors related to BigInt arithmetic
6. Updated all tests to handle BigInt comparisons

## Key Insights
- SQLite supports BIGINT natively, mapped to JavaScript BigInt by Prisma
- BigInt arithmetic requires all operands to be BigInt (can't mix with numbers)
- Test assertions need to compare BigInt with BigInt (0n not 0)
- Prisma handles BigInt serialization/deserialization automatically

## Future Considerations
- When displaying BigInt values in UI, may need to convert to string or number
- For very large numbers, consider formatting utilities
- API responses may need special handling for BigInt serialization

## SQLite Limitation Fix
- Discovered that SQLite doesn't support BIGINT with AUTOINCREMENT
- Changed SyncStatus.id back to Int since it's just for tracking sync operations
- This is sufficient as the sync status table won't have billions of rows

## Added clientMachineId to Messages Table
- Added clientMachineId as a direct foreign key in the messages table for consistency
- Previously messages only had indirect access to machine ID through session relationship
- Benefits:
  - Improved query performance - no joins needed to filter messages by machine
  - Consistency with other tables that have direct references to all context (user, project, machine)
  - Better analytics capabilities for machine-specific message aggregation
- Updated all code and tests to include clientMachineId when creating messages

[2025-06-16] Push Command Implementation

## Decision Rationale

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Separate Push Service**: Created a dedicated PushService class to handle all push-related logic, keeping business logic separate from the CLI command. This promotes testability and reusability.

2. **Batch Processing**: Implemented configurable batch sizes to handle large datasets efficiently. The SQL-based selection ensures natural resumption after interruptions without complex state management.

3. **Entity Deduplication**: Used Map data structures to deduplicate entities before sending, reducing payload size and server processing time. Maps maintain insertion order which could be useful for debugging.

4. **Retry Mechanism**: Leveraged the existing sync_status table with retry_count field instead of creating a separate state management system. This simplifies the implementation and makes it more robust.

### Key Insights

1. **Idempotency through Batch IDs**: Each push request includes a unique batch ID, allowing the server to handle duplicate requests gracefully.

2. **Transaction Safety**: All sync_status updates are wrapped in transactions to ensure atomicity when processing server responses.

3. **Progressive Feedback**: Used ora spinner with detailed progress messages to keep users informed during long-running operations.

### Problem Solving

1. **TypeScript Import Issues**: Initially imported unused entity types which caused compilation warnings. Removed them since TypeScript can infer the types from usage.

2. **Axios Error Handling**: The mock tests revealed that axios error objects need special handling. Had to cast errors to access axios-specific properties like isAxiosError.

3. **Test Structure**: Created both unit tests (mocking all dependencies) and integration tests (with mock server) to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Assumptions

1. **Server API Contract**: Assumed the server will always return structured responses even for partial failures, allowing fine-grained error handling.

2. **Message Ordering**: Messages are selected and pushed in chronological order (ORDER BY localTimestamp ASC) to maintain temporal consistency.

3. **Entity Relationships**: Assumed all messages have valid relationships to sessions, projects, machines, and users. The code handles missing optional fields gracefully.

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **State File**: Considered using a separate state file for push progress, but decided the sync_status table provides better reliability and crash recovery.

2. **Parallel Batches**: Considered processing multiple batches in parallel, but decided sequential processing is safer for initial implementation and easier to debug.

3. **Compression**: Considered gzipping request bodies, but decided to implement basic functionality first and add compression as an optimization later.

### Complex Logic Breakdown

1. **Entity Loading Strategy**: 
   - Single query with nested includes to load all related data
   - Reduces database round trips from potentially 5 queries to 1
   - Trade-off: Larger result set but better performance

2. **Response Processing**:
   - Uses Sets for O(1) lookup of persisted/deduplicated messages
   - Map for failed messages to preserve error details
   - Single transaction updates all records to maintain consistency

### TODOs and Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Add request body compression for large batches
   - Consider connection pooling for high-frequency pushes
   - Implement progress persistence for very large datasets

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Add exponential backoff for network errors
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
   - Add detailed error categorization for better user guidance

3. **Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - Add push duration tracking
   - Implement success rate monitoring
   - Create alerts for high failure rates

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add request signing for additional security
   - Implement API key rotation support
   - Add rate limiting awareness

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**: Focused on individual method behavior with all dependencies mocked. This allows testing edge cases and error conditions easily.

2. **Integration Tests**: Created a mock HTTP server to test the full push flow. This validates the integration between components and HTTP communication.

3. **Test Helpers**: Created reusable mock server and test data creation utilities to reduce test code duplication.

### Implementation Order Rationale

1. Started with type definitions to establish clear contracts
2. Implemented core service logic with clear separation of concerns
3. Added CLI commands with user-friendly output
4. Created comprehensive tests to ensure reliability
5. Fixed issues discovered during testing

The implementation follows the documented design closely while making practical adjustments discovered during development.

[2025-06-17 10:00] Analyzing Foreign Key Error in jsonl.service.js

## Problem Analysis

The foreign key constraint error is occurring at line 462 in the compiled JavaScript file (line 564 in the TypeScript source) when creating a new message record. The error indicates that a foreign key constraint is being violated.

## Key Findings

1. **Location of Error**: The error occurs in the `processMessage` method when calling `prisma.message.create()` at line 564 in the TypeScript source.

2. **Foreign Key Relationships**: The Message model has four foreign key relationships:
   - sessionId → Session (line 132 in schema)
   - projectId → Project (line 133 in schema)  
   - userId → User (line 134 in schema)
   - clientMachineId → Machine (line 135 in schema)

3. **Code Flow**:
   - `ensureUserAndMachine()` is called early (line 64) to create user and machine records
   - `ensureProject()` is called to create/get project (line 190)
   - Session is created/updated in `processJSONLFile` (lines 313-344)
   - Then messages are processed with these IDs

4. **Potential Issues Identified**:
   - The `machineId` is correctly obtained from `this.userService.getClientMachineId()` and passed to `processMessage`
   - All foreign key records should exist by the time messages are processed

## Possible Root Causes

1. **Transaction Issues**: The session/project/user/machine creation might not be committed before the message insert
2. **Data Inconsistency**: One of the IDs might be different than expected (e.g., sessionId from entry vs filename)
3. **Race Condition**: Parallel processing might cause records to be created out of order

## Debugging Approach

To identify which specific foreign key is failing, we could:
1. Add console.log statements before the message.create to log all foreign key values
2. Query the database to verify each referenced record exists
3. Check if any of the IDs are null or undefined

## Most Likely Cause

After careful analysis, the most suspicious area is the session creation. The code creates/updates the session with the sessionId from the filename, but then in processMessage, it uses `entry.sessionId`. If these don't match, the foreign key constraint would fail.

[2025-06-17] Session Creation Strategy Change

Issue: Foreign key constraint errors when creating messages
Original Approach: Created sessions based on filename, forced all messages to use that sessionId
Problem: JSONL files can contain messages from multiple sessions, forcing incorrect sessionId associations

New Approach: Dynamic session creation based on message data
1. Read sessionId from each message entry
2. Check if session exists before creating message
3. Create session if it doesn't exist
4. Track unique sessions in each file

Benefits:
- Preserves actual conversation structure
- No foreign key violations
- Supports multi-session files
- More accurate data representation

[2025-06-20] Hard-coded Values Analysis

SCOPE OF ANALYSIS:
- Analyzed the entire TypeScript codebase for hard-coded values that should be configurable
- Focused on values that would benefit users/admins rather than every literal value
- Looked for magic numbers, timeouts, batch sizes, file paths, URLs, and feature flags

FINDINGS SUMMARY:

1. WATCH COMMAND HARD-CODED VALUES:
   - stabilityThreshold: 2000ms (file write stability)
   - pollInterval: 100ms (file polling frequency)
   - Progress update throttling: 100ms
   - Default interval: 5000ms (if not specified in CLI)

2. LOGIN COMMAND TIMEOUTS:
   - Authentication timeout: 5000ms
   - Machine info version: 2 (for MAC-based approach)

3. FILE PROCESSING CONSTANTS:
   - Machine ID hash length: 16 characters (substring(0, 16))
   - Cache duration default: 5 minutes (hard-coded in jsonl.service.ts)
   - Project ID hash length: 16 characters
   - Error display limit: 10 errors max, first 10 shown

4. DISPLAY/UI FORMATTING:
   - Decimal places for costs: 4 (.toFixed(4))
   - Decimal places for processing speed: 1 (.toFixed(1))
   - Decimal places for duration: 2 (.toFixed(2))
   - Session display limit: 5 sessions max
   - Progress update frequency: 100ms throttling

5. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
   - "projects" subdirectory (hard-coded path component)
   - JSONL file extension matching
   - Project name prefix cleaning pattern: /^-Users-[^-]+-/

6. PRICING SERVICE:
   - Synthetic model list (hard-coded model names)
   - Default pricing values (fallback when API fails)
   - Model mapping (variant to base model mapping)

7. NETWORK INTERFACE FILTERING:
   - Priority prefixes for network interfaces: ['en', 'eth', 'wlan', 'wl', 'wifi']
   - Excluded interface patterns: 'utun', 'awdl', 'llw', 'veth', 'docker', 'br-', 'lo'

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move file watcher settings to config
2. Add timeout configurations for network operations
3. Make display limits configurable
4. Allow customization of hash lengths and precision
5. Make directory structure configurable
6. Allow custom model mappings and synthetic model definitions
