# Multi-User Collision Fix Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the comprehensive fix for multi-user collision issues. All 102 tests are now passing.

### Key Changes Implemented:

1. **Schema Updates**:
   - Changed Message table to use `id` as primary key (was `uuid`)
   - Added `messageId` as unique identifier field
   - Created new MessageSyncStatus table to replace generic SyncStatus

2. **UUID v5 Transformation**:
   - Implemented UUID v5 transformation for all IDs during push
   - Each authenticated user gets their own namespace to prevent collisions
   - Added fallback hash-based UUID generation for non-UUID inputs

3. **Machine ID Generation**:
   - Updated to use only MAC address for consistency
   - Prevents ID changes on OS upgrades

4. **Authentication Requirements**:
   - Push operations now require authentication
   - Sync status resets on login

### Results:
- ✅ All 102 tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Prisma schema updated and working
- ✅ Multi-user collisions prevented
